Social anxiety can make everyday interactions feel overwhelming.
Wobble turns confidence-building into a game, helping users grow one small step at a time.

If you want, I can also create **a more visual README** with badges, GIF demos, and a streak progress diagram — that makes it stand out a lot more on GitHub.

Do you want me to prepare that upgraded visual version?
